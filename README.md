##  Overview

This repository serves as my personal journey to master fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms. The primary goals are:

*   **To Learn:** Deepen my understanding of algorithmic concepts and their time/space complexity.
*   **To Reference:** Create a well-documented codebase for quick revision.
*   **To Prepare:** Aiding in technical interview preparation for software engineering roles.
*   **To Practice:** Implementing robust and efficient C++ code using modern standards (C++17/20).

##  Repository Structure

The repository is organized logically for easy navigation:

--> the data struchture as the heading 
 ---> algorithms involving that data strhcutre
 --> all the questions related to that data struchture or algorithm


##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`) supporting C++17 or later.
*   A code editor (like VS Code, CLion) or IDE.
*   (Optional) `make` for building using the provided Makefile.

###compilation Example
bash : 
g++ -std=c++17 sorting/quick_sort.cpp -o quick_sort
./quick_sort

--> Usage
